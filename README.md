# Transfer Learning from Scratch

This repository contains the implementation of a basic neural network model to demonstrate transfer learning from scratch, using the MNIST dataset. The project is structured to first train a model on odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and then apply transfer learning techniques to adapt the model to recognize even numbers (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
